## Abstract

In this paper, we present a meshless solution of natural convection from the heated cylinder.
The numerical technique is constructed around Weighted Least Squares approximation that is
used to evaluate derivatives needed to solve partial differential equations governing the
problem at hand, i.e. Navier-Stokes, mass continuity, and heat transport. The results are
presented in terms of temperature and velocity magnitude contour plots, as well as a more
quantitative comparison with reference data in terms of Nusselt number and maximal velocity
values. Three different cases are tackled, namely the standard de Vahl Davis case, natural
convection from the heated cylinder, and cooling of overhead power line due to the natural
convection under realistic conditions.
