## Abstract

Since the advent of mesh-free methods as a tool for the numerical analysis of systems of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), many variants of differential operator approximation have been proposed. In this work, we propose a local mesh-free strong-form method that combines the stability of Radial Basis Function-Generated Finite Differences (RBF-FD) with the computational effectiveness of Diffuse Approximation Method (DAM), forming a so-called hybrid method. To demonstrate the advantages of a hybrid method, we evaluate its computational complexity and accuracy of the obtained numerical solution by solving a two-dimensional Poisson problem with an exponentially strong source in the computational domain. Finally, we employ the hybrid method to solve a three-dimensional Boussinesq's problem on an isotropic half-space and show that the implementation overhead can be justified.
