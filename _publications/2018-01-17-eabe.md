## Abstract

This paper considers a numerical solution of a linear elasticity problem, namely the Cauchy–Navier
equation, using a strong form method based on a local Weighted Least Squares (WLS) approximation.
The main advantage of the employed numerical approach, also referred to as a Meshless Local Strong
Form method, is its generality in terms of approximation setup and positions of computational nodes.
In this paper, flexibility regarding the nodal position is demonstrated through two numerical
examples, i.e. a drilled cantilever beam, where an irregular domain is treated with a relatively
simple nodal positioning algorithm, and a Hertzian contact problem, where again, a relatively simple
h-refinement algorithm is used to extensively refine discretization under the contact area. The
results are presented in terms of accuracy and convergence rates, using different approximations and
refinement setups, namely Gaussian and monomial based approximations, and a comparison of execution
time for each block of the solution procedure.
