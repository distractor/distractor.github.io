Work experience
------
- Dec 2017 -- (present): Self-employed
    - Detailed studies of DXF file format. Programming a DXF file exporter in Pascal programming language.
    - Advanced use of Excel - macros, VBA, C#.
    - Developed dedicated Finite Element Method mesher.
    - Ongoing support developing paragliders.
    - Data acqusition for predictive models (C#).
    - Development of trading engine (C#).
    - Front end development of web apps (vue, .net).

- Mar 2019 -- Feb 2024 (expected): PhD student
    - "Jožef Stefan" Institute
    - Researching adaptivity in meshless methods.
    - Working on a library for PDE solving using meshless methods with concrete applications.
    - Parallel and distributed computing on GPUs with CUDA.
    - Solving Poisson equation in multidimensional space.
    - Study plastic deformation of an aluminium block when exposed to extreme temperatures with FreeFEM++ and meshless methods.
    - Moving boundary problem simulation - dendritic growth.
    - Dynamic Thermal Rating (DTR) of overhead power lines and uncertainty of DTR.
    - Finalizing PhD research.
    - Supervisor: [dr. Gregor Kosec](http://e6.ijs.si/~gkosec/)


- Jul 2014 -- Dec 2017: Assistant to head of R&D
    - NOVA Vertriebsgesellschaft m.b.H.
    - Setting up a model of "ballooning effect" and its implementation in the prototyping protocol via a Mathemathica/Python software.
    - Production quality assurance via precise experimental work.
    - Translations and other minor works on their [webpage](www.nova.eu).

- Oct 2016 -- Nov 2017: Research intern
    - "Jožef Stefan" Institute
    - Working on my masters thesis: "Identification of dynamic systems using deep Gaussian Processes". 
    - Using supervised learning method we predicted the air temperature around a nuclear plant Krško (Slovenia). Results showed that using deep models is an overkill single layered models produced better results with less computation time.

- Nov 2009 -- Jun 2011: Student work
    - Animating guests of all age.
    - Organisation and leading all the big events (+1000 people).
    - Responsible for entertainment while youngsters were celebrating a birthday party.
