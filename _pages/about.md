I am a scientific researcher and a PhD student at the [Parallel and Distributed systems Laboratory](http://e6.ijs.si/ParallelAndDistributedSystems/), [Department E6](http://e6.ijs.si/), [Jo≈æef Stefan Institute](http://ijs.si/) and a self-employed developer.

## As a researcher 

I am currently involved in the development of [Medusa library](http://e6.ijs.si/medusa) for meshless solutions of PDEs with strong form methods along with working on research into adaptivity for meshless methods, as well as multiple practical projects which use the library. 

My research is focused on hp-adaptive solution procedures and different approximation methods with an emphasis on practical problems including but not limited to heat transfer, elastic/plastic deformation, fluid flow, etc.

## As self-employed

I was heavily involved in software development used for design and construction of paragliders. Including export of DXF patterns and automatic creation of FEM mesh.

Additionally, I was also involved in development of web trading application (backend and frontend).

# Open to work?

YES. Feel free to contact me if you have an interesting project.

## Demonstrated work in

- Software development: C++, C#, .net, Python, typescript, FreePascal
- Numerical analysis: Abaqus, FreeFem++
- Writing: Latex
- ...

**Absolutely willing to learn new things!**
