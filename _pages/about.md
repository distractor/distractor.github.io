I am a scientific researcher and a PhD student at the [Parallel and Distributed systems Laboratory](http://e6.ijs.si/ParallelAndDistributedSystems/), [Department E6](http://e6.ijs.si/), [Jo≈æef Stefan Institute](http://ijs.si/) and a self-employed developer/computational scientist.

## As a researcher

I was involved in the development of [Medusa library](http://e6.ijs.si/medusa) for meshless solutions of PDEs with strong form methods as well as researching the adaptive solution procedures employing meshless methods. I also cooperated on multiple practical projects which use the library.

My research is focused on the efficient solution procedures employing meshless methods. Particularly the hp-adaptive solution procedure and different approximation methods with an emphasis on practical problems including but not limited to heat transfer, elastic/plastic deformation, fluid flow, etc.

## As self-employed

- I was heavily involved in software development used for design and construction of paragliders. Including export of DXF patterns and automatic creation of FEM mesh. All of the work was done for [NOVA](https://www.nova.eu/en/home/).
- I was also involved in development of web trading applications (backend and frontend).
- Extensive research on the different approaches to downscaling mesoscopic forecasts to higher resolutions. This also resulted in a prototype implementation of the CALMET's approach.

# Open to work?
