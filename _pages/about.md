I am a Software Engineer working for Google in Zürich.

Previously I was a post-graduate researcher (and a PhD student before that) at the
[Parallel and Distribute systems Laboratory](http://e6.ijs.si/ParallelAndDistributedSystems/),
[Department E6](http://e6.ijs.si/),
[Jožef Stefan Institute](http://ijs.si/),
and a teaching assistant at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](http://www.fmf.uni-lj.si), [University
of Ljubljana](https://www.uni-lj.si/).
I am currently developing the [Medusa library](http://e6.ijs.si/medusa) for meshless solutions of PDEs with
strong form methods along with working on research into adaptivity for meshless methods, as well as
multiple practical projects which use the library.

I am a mathematician and a software engineer, both of which I use in my research and day to day
life.
