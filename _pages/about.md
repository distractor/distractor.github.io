I am a PhD student at [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](http://www.fmf.uni-lj.si), [University
of Ljubljana](https://www.uni-lj.si/) and PhD researcher at
[Parallel and Distribute systems Laboratory](http://e6.ijs.si/ParallelAndDistributedSystems/),
[Department E6](http://e6.ijs.si/),
[Jožef Stefan Institute](http://ijs.si/),
under supervision of [dr. Gregor Kosec](http://e6.ijs.si/~gkosec/).

Previously, I did two 3 month internships at Google, one in Zürich and one in Mountain View, CA.

I am a mathematician and a software engineer, both of which I use in my research and day to day
life.
