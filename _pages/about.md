I am a post-graduate researcher at the 
[Parallel and Distribute systems Laboratory](http://e6.ijs.si/ParallelAndDistributedSystems/),
[Department E6](http://e6.ijs.si/),
[Jožef Stefan Institute](http://ijs.si/),
an a teaching assistant at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](http://www.fmf.uni-lj.si), [University
of Ljubljana](https://www.uni-lj.si/) t

Previously, I did three 3 month internships at Google, one remote in 2020, one in 2016 in Zürich and one in 2014 in Mountain View, CA.

I am a mathematician and a software engineer, both of which I use in my research and day to day
life.

I am currently developing the [Medusa library](http://e6.ijs.si/medusa) for meshless solutions of PDEs with
strong form methods as well as working on research and practical projects which use the library.
