## <a target="_blank" href="https://e6.ijs.si/ParallelAndDistributedSystems/projects/eles_mn/"> Uncertainty module for DTR</a>

High-voltage transmission lines represent an important segment of the electric power transmission network. They not only connect the production and consumption network in Slovenia, but also connect the Slovenian transmission system with neighboring ones. In the last years, we witness an extremely rapid development of the electricity market and services, mainly due to the inclusion of renewable electricity resources in the network. System operators in recent years have faced challenges in how to ensure maximum transmission capacity of the system to satisfy market needs, while maintaining operational safety and permissible impact on the environment. A great help in the decision-making process was introduced with the Dynamic Thermal Rating (DTR) â€“ an instrument to monitor the temperatures of conductors by using weather and load forecasting to estimate their future trend in order to calculate the ampacity of a transmission line. However, the introduction of DTR raises a number of questions related to the accuracy and uncertainty of the results of thermal assessment and the level of acceptable risk and its management. In order to prepare a conceptual solution for estimating the uncertainty of the dynamic thermal flow as a result of the DTR process, we examined the weather and transmission conditions on two locations (routes) in Slovenia: Podlog and Bevkov vrh.
