A conference talk about my work on extracting precise heart-rate variability from a noised ECG
signal obtained from a
[wearable ECG sensor](http://www-e6.ijs.si/ParallelAndDistributedSystems/#!EcgSensor)
developed in our department.

You can also download the [paper]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/CP_2016_SlakKosec_Mipro.pdf) and the
